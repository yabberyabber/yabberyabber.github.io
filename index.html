        <p>I'll make a real website eventually.  In the meantime, here's some cool miscellaneous stuff in no particular order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I work at Arista Networks writing tools that make developers more productive</li>
            <li>I recently finished a masters degree Cal Poly SLO studying computer science</li>
            <li>My thesis is in static analysis of C++.  I'm adding user-defined type qualifiers to function definitions to statically enforce call-tree constraints</li>
            <li>If you're looking for the 2017-2018 cal poly marching band trombone roster, <a href="http://andrew2nelson.com/trombone-roster">the link is right here.</a></li>
            <li>If you'd like to make a change to the 2017-2018 cal poly marching band trombone roster, <a href="http://github.com/yabberyabber/trombone-roster">submit a PR to the github</a></li>
            <li>Github as a social network: I firmly believe that github is a tool that can be used by everyone - not just programmers.  As such, I have a few repositories that I run that are intended for non-coding-related recreation.  Please submit some PRs!
